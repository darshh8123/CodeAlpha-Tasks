# CodeAlpha-Task1

This repository contains my completed tasks for the CodeAlpha Data Science internship. The project focuses on a loan dataset, and the analysis covers three key areas: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, and Sentiment Analysis.

### **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* **Objective:** To understand the structure, characteristics, and initial patterns within the loan dataset.
* **Key Activities:**
    * Performed data inspection using `df.info()` and `df.describe()`.
    * Checked for and confirmed the absence of missing values.
    * Analyzed the distribution of key variables, such as `person_age`, `loan_amnt`, and `loan_int_rate`.
    * Identified preliminary trends and outliers.
